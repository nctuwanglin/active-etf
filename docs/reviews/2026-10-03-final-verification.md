# Final review and verification

Reviewed the entire working change against baseline `0b9643d` using an independent reviewer, then independently reproduced the findings and fixes. User authorized GitHub push after review and verification on 2026-10-03.

## Findings resolved

1. Same-day A → B → A corrections now compare against the latest revision only, preserving the final correction and retaining original history.
2. The next normal updater run preserves all legacy batch-dated events verbatim under `legacy_events`, outside the verified `events` stream. Real-data dry-run preserved all 3,094 legacy records; 132 current events have unique period identities; rerun is idempotent. Offline rebuilding leaves the existing perf_stats file untouched.
3. Daily events and trend intervals share the minimum-three-common-holdings and 0.2–5 scale validity gate. Insufficient evidence produces null adjusted estimates while retaining raw changes.
4. New batch watermarks use the latest valid holdings date, preserving ETF observations that advance before the majority. Invalid ISO dates are rejected; ambiguous legacy future labels remain quarantined.
5. Reverse lookup events retain their true period endpoint; baseline chart points are no longer misleadingly clickable.

## Verification evidence

- 203 Python unittest tests pass, including new red-to-green regressions.
- Node trend data/selection/ranking/CSV tests pass.
- Generated-page unit DOM smoke passes initialization, period/stock/direction switching, CSV export and chart-date interactions.
- Python compilation, JS syntax check and git diff --check pass.
- All 41 raw historical snapshots plus registry and perf_stats are byte-for-byte unchanged from baseline.
- Production legacy-event migration was tested in memory only; no live source refresh or raw migration performed.
- Independent review found no remaining Critical or Important issues.
- Git fetch succeeded; origin/main matches baseline before commit.

## Remaining release verification

Actual desktop and narrow/mobile viewport visual verification cannot be performed through the browser tool because its local-page security denial remains in effect. No alternate browser/server workaround was attempted. User-side layout verification has been requested and remains pending. Unit DOM checks are not a substitute for visual verification.

Live GitHub CI/Pages deployment can only be assessed after the authorized push; no claim of deployment success is made here.
